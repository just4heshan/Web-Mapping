# python_folium

Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map.
The idea of the project is to use the functionalities of folium and plot volacones positions and represent 
world population on the map rendered by folium. Pandas is used to read data from csv and json files and provide
that data to folium.
